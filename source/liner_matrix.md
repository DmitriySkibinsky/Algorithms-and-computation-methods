## Introduction to the Solution of Linear Equations

Solving linear equations is a fundamental aspect of algebra and is pivotal in various fields such as science, engineering, economics, and computer science. Linear equations involve variables that are only to the first power, and they can represent a multitude of real-world problems, from simple budgeting calculations to complex engineering systems.

A system of linear equations is a set of equations where each equation is linear. For example, a system with two variables 𝑥 and 𝑦 might look like:

​
 
where 
𝑎
1
a 
1
​
 , 
𝑏
1
b 
1
​
 , 
𝑐
1
c 
1
​
 , 
𝑎
2
a 
2
​
 , 
𝑏
2
b 
2
​
 , and 
𝑐
2
c 
2
​
  are constants. The goal is to find values for 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Methods of Solving Linear Equations
There are several methods to solve systems of linear equations:

Graphical Method: Plotting each equation on a graph and finding the point(s) where they intersect.
Substitution Method: Solving one equation for one variable and substituting that expression into the other equation.
Elimination Method: Adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable, making it easier to solve for the remaining variable.
Matrix Methods: Using matrices and operations such as Gaussian elimination to systematically solve the system.
