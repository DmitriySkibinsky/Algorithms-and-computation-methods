# Algorithms and computation methods

This repository discusses mechanisms for solving mathematical problems using the Python programming language. Of course, many algorithms are already present in libraries such as NumPy or SciPy, but here we tried to use prepared algorithms as little as possible. We will use the Matplotlib library for visualization and better understanding of the algorithm. We will talk about the pros and cons of using algorithms. Here we will consider and show examples of such topics as: 

1. [Numerical Integration](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/num_integration.md)
2. [Solution of linear equations](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/liner_matrix.md)
3. [Solution of nonlinear equations](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/nonliner_matrix.md)
4. [Approximation and interpolation](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/interpolation.md)
5. [Approximation by trigonometric functions. Fourier series](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/fourier.md)
6. [Multivariate optimization of continuous functions](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/optimization.md)
7. [Multivariate Discrete Optimization](https://github.com/DmitriySkibinsky/Algorithms-and-computation-methods/blob/main/source/discrete.md)
