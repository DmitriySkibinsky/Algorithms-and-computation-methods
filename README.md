# Algorithms and computation methods

![](./sour—Åe/logo.png)

This repository discusses mechanisms for solving mathematical problems using the Python programming language. Here we will consider and show examples of such topics as: 

1. [Numerical Integration](./num_integration.md)
2. Solution of linear equations
3. Solution of nonlinear equations
4. Approximation and interpolation
5. Approximation by trigonometric functions. Fourier series
6. Multivariate optimization of continuous functions
7. Multivariate Discrete Optimization
